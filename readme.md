# Garbage Classification

## Project Goal and Motivation

The project was to develop a machine learning model to classify waste images into two categories. organic and recyclable. For this the Waste Classification Dataset from mendeley was used.

Efficient waste classification is critical for waste management systems. Helping to reduce waste and promote recycling is key to improve sustainability. Improving efficiency and accuracy for waste sorting will improve sustainability (reducing improper disposal, reducing pollution, more recycling, etc.). For example, the project could contribute to a more efficient recycling process and help achieving sustanability goals.

## Data

The data source was the Waste Classification Dataset on mendeley data. https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n3gtgm9jxj/2
The dataset has a collection of 24705 images of household waste. The images are categorised into two classes: organic (13880 images) and recyclable (10825 images).
